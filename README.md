# Guessing Game

This is a simple Python guessing game where you try to guess a random number between 0 and a user-defined range. The program provides feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low, and it counts the number of guesses it takes for you to find the correct number.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Run the Python script `guessing_game.py` in your preferred Python environment.


## Usage

- Input your desired range to generate a random number within that range.
- Make guesses by entering numeric values.
- The program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
- The program will display the number of guesses it took to find the correct number.
